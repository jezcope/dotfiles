$0This project is about changing this by looking at that and doing the
other.

## Project Outline ##

### Background and Why the Project Needs Doing ###

Something or other isn’t working well and so-and-so asked us to sort it
out.

### Scope ###

-   We’ll be doing this for so-and-so.
-   We won’t be doing that.

### Objectives ###

-   Produce a widget.
-   Train the users in using it.

### Strategy ###

1.  The team will discuss with users what they’d like, and review what
    is available off the shelf.
2.  We’ll then agree exactly what we’re going to deliver.
3.  CiCS will then do whatever and the users will test it.
4.  The users will sort out how their processes will need to change and
    we’ll all agree a time for go-live.

### Costs ###

The software is likely to be open source but we’ll probably need a
server, though a virtual server may do.

### Concerns and Risks ###

This project depends on some other thing being completed on time.

The suppliers are unreliable.

There is a deadline of whenever and timescales are tight. If necessary
we can drop whatever and maybe pick it up after go-live.
